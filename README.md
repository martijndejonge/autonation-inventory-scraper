# AutoNation Dealership Inventory Scraper

This Python project scrapes **new and used vehicle inventory data** from over 250 AutoNation dealership websites. 
It extracts full listings from each dealer‚Äôs `/all-inventory` page using dynamic API calls, parses the JSON payload, and stores the results as `.json` files per dealer ‚Äî with automatic chunking for large datasets.
